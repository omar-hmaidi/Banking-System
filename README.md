## 📖 About the Project

The Smart Banking Suite aims to simulate a real-world banking client management system via a console application. The code is designed following clean architecture principles — focusing on modularity, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

The project is structured using small, single-responsibility functions with clear division of tasks and file-based data persistence.
